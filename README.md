This repository hosts a partial implementation of an IDL compiler
for Rust. The eventual goal was to support interoperability between Rust
programs and DDS implementations, for use in embedded systems.

[June 2019] Due to shifts in contract priority, we are no longer actively
developing this code base, although we hope to return to it in the future. We
are happy to work with other possible users of this code to improve it, both for
the stated purpose of interacting with DDS, as well as interaction with other
IDL-compliant systems.
